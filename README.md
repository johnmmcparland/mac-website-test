Tests for the [Motherwell AC Website](https://www.motherwellac.com)

The intention is to provide a set of automated tests that can be run to verify
various required links still work, contact us, social links etc.

Other types of testing required 
 * [Security - WPScans.com](https://www.wpscans.com)
 * [Link Checker - W3C](https://validator.w3.org/checklink)
 
It is implemented in SoapUI for ease of creation - many tests are very similar.
Alternative was ChimpJS + Cucumber.
